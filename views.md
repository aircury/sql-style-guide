# Views

## Always explicitly name the columns a view exposes

Never rely on `SELECT *` in a view definition. Always list the columns the view exposes by name. This prevents silent breakage when the underlying table gains, loses, or reorders columns.

##### Example

Bad:
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_students AS
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE is_active IS true
```

Good:
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_students AS
SELECT
    id,
    full_name,
    cohort,
    school_id
FROM students
WHERE is_active IS true
```

## Avoid view proliferation

Do not create views as a default abstraction layer. Each view should exist because it solves a specific, recurring problem, such as enforcing access control, encapsulating a complex join, or standardising a derived metric. If a view has no clear purpose, it becomes maintenance burden without value.

##### Example

Bad:
```sql
-- A view that just mirrors the base table with no added value
CREATE VIEW students_view AS
SELECT
    id,
    full_name,
    cohort,
    school_id,
    is_active
FROM students
```

Good:
```sql
-- A view that encapsulates a meaningful, reusable definition
CREATE VIEW active_students_with_school AS
SELECT
    students.id,
    students.full_name,
    students.cohort,
    schools.name AS school_name
FROM students
INNER JOIN schools
    ON students.school_id = schools.id
WHERE students.is_active IS true
```
